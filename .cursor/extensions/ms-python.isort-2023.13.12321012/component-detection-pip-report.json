methods](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-dunder-methods)).\n[Trusted by NASA](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-achievement) for Mars missions since 2020!\n\nIts main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\n*attrs* would not be possible without our [amazing sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hynek).\nEspecially those generously supporting us at the *The Organization* tier and higher:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n   <a href=\"https://www.variomedia.de/\"><img src=\"https://www.attrs.org/en/23.2.0/_static/sponsors/Variomedia.svg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\" /></a>\n   <a href=\"https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-attrs?utm_source=pypi-attrs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise&utm_term=repo\"><img

src=\"https://www.attrs.org/en/23.2.0/_static/sponsors/FilePreviews.svg\" width=\"200\" height=\"60\"/></a>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n   <strong>Please consider <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/hynek\">joining them</a> to help make <em>attrs</em>’s maintenance more sustainable!</strong>\n</p>\n\n<!-- teaser-end -->\n\n## Example\n\n*attrs* gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:\n\n<!-- code-begin -->\n\n```pycon\n>>> from attrs import asdict, define, make_class, Factory\n\n>>> @define\n... class SomeClass:\n...     a_number: int = 42\n...     list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)\n...\n...     def hard_math(self, another_number):\n...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number\n\n\n>>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\n>>> sc\nSomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])\n\n>>> sc.hard_math(3)\n19\n>>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])\nTrue\n>>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])\nTrue\n\n>>> asdict(sc)\n{'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}\n\n>>> SomeClass()\nSomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])\n\n>>> C = make_class(\"C\", [\"a\", \"b\"])\n>>> C(\"foo\", \"bar\")\nC(a='foo', b='bar')\n```\n\nAfter *declaring* your attributes, *attrs* gives you:\n\n- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,\n- a nice human-readable `__repr__`,\n- equality-checking methods,\n- an initializer,\n- and much more,\n\n*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.\n\n**Hate type annotations**!?\nNo problem!\nTypes are entirely **optional** with *attrs*.\nSimply assign `attrs.field()` to the attributes instead of annotating them with types.\n\n---\n\nThis example uses *attrs*'s modern APIs that have been introduced in version 20.1.0, and the *attrs* package import name that has been added in version 21.3.0.\nThe classic APIs (`@attr.s`, `attr.ib`, plus their serious-business aliases) and the `attr` package import name will remain **indefinitely**.\n\nPlease check out [*On The Core API Names*](https://www.attrs.org/en/latest/names.html) for a more in-depth explanation.\n\n\n## Data Classes\n\nOn the tin, *attrs* might remind you of `dataclasses` (and indeed, `dataclasses` [are a descendant](https://hynek.me/articles/import-attrs/) of *attrs*).\nIn practice it does a lot more and is more flexible.\nFor instance it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy arrays for equality checks](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/comparison.html#customization), allows more ways to [plug into the initialization process](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html#hooking-yourself-into-initialization), and allows for stepping through the generated methods using a debugger.\n\nFor more details, please refer to our [comparison page](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#data-classes).\n\n\n## Project Information\n\n- [**Changelog**](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/changelog.html)\n-

annotation for `attrs.resolve_types()` is now correct.\n  [#1141](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1141)\n- Type stubs now use `typing.dataclass_transform` to decorate dataclass-like decorators, instead of the non-standard `__dataclass_transform__` special form, which is only supported by Pyright.\n  [#1158](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1158)\n- Fixed serialization of namedtuple fields using `attrs.asdict/astuple()` with `retain_collection_types=True`.\n  [#1165](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1165)\n- `attrs.AttrsInstance` is now a `typing.Protocol` in both type hints and code.\n  This allows you to subclass it along with another `Protocol`.\n  [#1172](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1172)\n- If *attrs* detects that `__attrs_pre_init__` accepts more than just `self`, it will call it with the same arguments as `__init__` was called.\n  This allows you to, for example, pass arguments to `super().__init__()`.\n  [#1187](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1187)\n- Slotted classes now transform `functools.cached_property` decorated methods to support equivalent semantics.\n  [#1200](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1200)\n- Added *class_body* argument to `attrs.make_class()` to provide additional attributes for newly created classes.\n  It is, for example, now possible to attach methods.\n  [#1203](https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/1203)\n\n\n---\n\n[Full

classes, dataclasses and the usual\nPython collections, but other kinds of classes are supported by manually\nregistering converters.\n\nPython has a rich set of powerful, easy to use, built-in data types like\ndictionaries, lists and tuples. These data types are also the lingua franca\nof most data serialization libraries, for formats like json, msgpack, cbor,\nyaml or toml.\n\nData types like this, and mappings like `dict` s in particular, represent\nunstructured data. Your data is, in all likelihood, structured: not all\ncombinations of field names or values are valid inputs to your programs. In\nPython, structured data is better represented with classes and enumerations.\n_attrs_ is an excellent library for declaratively describing the structure of\nyour data, and validating it.\n\nWhen you're handed unstructured data (by your network, file system, database...),\n_cattrs_ helps to convert this data into structured data. When you have to\nconvert your structured data into data types other libraries can handle,\n_cattrs_ turns your classes and enumerations into dictionaries, integers and\nstrings.\n\nHere's a simple taste. The list containing a float, an int and a string\ngets converted into a tuple of three ints.\n\n```python\n>>> import cattrs\n\n>>> cattrs.structure([1.0, 2, \"3\"], tuple[int, int, int])\n(1, 2, 3)\n```\n\n_cattrs_ works well with _attrs_ classes out of the box.\n\n```python\n>>> from attrs import frozen\n>>> import cattrs\n\n>>> @frozen  # It works with non-frozen classes too.\n... class C:\n...     a: int\n...     b: str\n\n>>> instance = C(1, 'a')\n>>> cattrs.unstructure(instance)\n{'a': 1, 'b': 'a'}\n>>> cattrs.structure({'a': 1, 'b': 'a'}, C)\nC(a=1, b='a')\n```\n\nHere's a much more complex example, involving `attrs` classes with type\nmetadata.\n\n```python\n>>> from enum import unique, Enum\n>>> from typing import Optional, Sequence, Union\n>>> from cattrs import structure, unstructure\n>>> from attrs import define, field\n\n>>> @unique\n... class CatBreed(Enum):\n...     SIAMESE = \"siamese\"\n...     MAINE_COON = \"maine_coon\"\n...     SACRED_BIRMAN = \"birman\"\n\n>>> @define\n... class Cat:\n...     breed: CatBreed\n...     names: Sequence[str]\n\n>>> @define\n... class DogMicrochip:\n...     chip_id = field()  # Type annotations are optional, but recommended\n...     time_chipped: float = field()\n\n>>> @define\n... class Dog:\n...     cuteness: int\n...     chip: Optional[DogMicrochip] = None\n\n>>> p = unstructure([Dog(cuteness=1, chip=DogMicrochip(chip_id=1, time_chipped=10.0)),\n...                  Cat(breed=CatBreed.MAINE_COON, names=('Fluffly', 'Fluffer'))])\n\n>>> print(p)\n[{'cuteness': 1, 'chip': {'chip_id': 1, 'time_chipped': 10.0}}, {'breed': 'maine_coon', 'names': ('Fluffly', 'Fluffer')}]\n>>> print(structure(p, list[Union[Dog, Cat]]))\n[Dog(cuteness=1, chip=DogMicrochip(chip_id=1, time_chipped=10.0)), Cat(breed=<CatBreed.MAINE_COON: 'maine_coon'>, names=['Fluffly', 'Fluffer'])]\n```\n\nConsider unstructured data a low-level representation that needs to be converted\nto structured data to be handled, and use `structure`. When you're done,\n`unstructure` the data to its unstructured form and pass it along to another\nlibrary or module. Use [attrs type metadata](http://attrs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#types)\nto add type metadata to attributes, so _cattrs_ will know how to structure and\ndestructure them.\n\n- Free software: MIT license\n- Documentation: https://catt.rs\n- Python versions supported: 3.8 and up. (Older Python versions are supported by older versions; see the changelog.)\n\n## Features\n\n- Converts structured data into unstructured data, recursively:\n\n  - _attrs_ classes and dataclasses are converted into dictionaries in a way similar to `attrs.asdict`, or into tuples in a way similar to `attrs.astuple`.\n  - Enumeration instances are converted to their values.\n  - Other types are let through without conversion. This includes types such as\n    integers, dictionaries, lists and instances of non-_attrs_ classes.\n  - Custom converters for any type can be registered using `register_unstructure_hook`.\n\n- Converts unstructured data into structured data, recursively, according to\n  your specification given as a type. The following types are supported:\n\n  - `typing.Optional[T]`.\n  - `typing.List[T]`, `typing.MutableSequence[T]`, `typing.Sequence[T]` (converts to a list).\n  - `typing.Tuple` (both variants, `Tuple[T, ...]` and `Tuple[X, Y, Z]`).\n  - `typing.MutableSet[T]`, `typing.Set[T]` (converts to a set).\n  - `typing.FrozenSet[T]` (converts to a frozenset).\n  - `typing.Dict[K, V]`, `typing.MutableMapping[K, V]`, `typing.Mapping[K, V]` (converts to a dict).\n  - `typing.TypedDict`.\n  - _attrs_ classes with simple attributes and the usual `__init__`.\n\n    - Simple attributes are attributes that can be assigned unstructured data,\n      like numbers, strings, and collections of unstructured data.\n\n  - All _attrs_ classes and dataclasses with the usual `__init__`, if their complex attributes have type metadata.\n  - `typing.Union` s of supported _attrs_ classes, given that all of the classes have a unique field.\n  - `typing.Union` s of anything, given that you provide a disambiguation function for it.\n  - Custom converters for any type can be registered using `register_structure_hook`.\n\n_cattrs_ comes with preconfigured converters for a number of serialization libraries, including json, msgpack, cbor2, bson, yaml and toml.\nFor details, see the [cattrs.preconf package](https://catt.rs/en/stable/preconf.html).\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n_cattrs_ is based on a few fundamental design decisions.\n\n- Un/structuring rules are separate from the models.\n  This allows models to have a one-to-many relationship with un/structuring rules, and to create un/structuring rules for models which you do not own and you cannot change.\n  (_cattrs_ can be configured to use un/structuring rules from models using the [`use_class_methods` strategy](https://catt.rs/en/latest/strategies.html#using-class-specific-structure-and-unstructure-methods).)\n- Invent as little as possible; reuse existing ordinary Python instead.\n  For example, _cattrs_ did not have a custom exception type to group exceptions until the sanctioned Python [`exceptiongroups`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ExceptionGroup).\n  A side-effect of this design decision is that, in a lot of cases, when you're solving _cattrs_ problems you're actually learning Python instead of learning _cattrs_.\n- Refuse the temptation to guess.\n  If there are two ways of solving a problem, _cattrs_ should refuse to guess and let the user configure it themselves.\n\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds so these decisions can and are sometimes broken, but they have proven to be a good foundation.\n\n## Additional documentation and talks\n\n- [On structured and unstructured data, or the case for cattrs](https://threeofwands.com/on-structured-and-unstructured-data-or-the-case-for-cattrs/)\n- [Why I use attrs instead of pydantic](https://threeofwands.com/why-i-use-attrs-instead-of-pydantic/)\n- [cattrs I: un/structuring speed](https://threeofwands.com/why-cattrs-is-so-fast/)\n- [Python has a macro language - it's Python (PyCon IT 2022)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYRSixikUTo)\n- [Intro to cattrs 23.1](https://threeofwands.com/intro-to-cattrs-23-1-0/)\n\n## Credits\n\nMajor credits to Hynek Schlawack for creating [attrs](https://attrs.org) and its predecessor, [characteristic](https://github.com/hynek/characteristic).\n\n_cattrs_ is tested with [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), by David R.

This function returns a context manager\nthat calls the given handler for any exceptions matching the sole argument.\n\nThe argument to ``catch()`` must be a dict (or any ``Mapping``) where each key is either\nan exception class or an iterable of exception classes. Each value must be a callable\nthat takes a single positional argument. The handler will be called at most once, with\nan exception group as an argument which will contain all the exceptions that are any\nof the given types, or their subclasses. The exception group may contain nested groups\ncontaining more matching exceptions.\n\nThus, the following Python 3.11+ code:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    try:\n        ...\n    except* (ValueError, KeyError) as excgroup:\n        for exc in excgroup.exceptions:\n            print('Caught exception:', type(exc))\n    except* RuntimeError:\n        print('Caught runtime error')\n\nwould be written with this backport like this:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    from exceptiongroup import ExceptionGroup, catch\n\n    def value_key_err_handler(excgroup: ExceptionGroup) -> None:\n        for exc in excgroup.exceptions:\n            print('Caught exception:', type(exc))\n\n    def runtime_err_handler(exc: ExceptionGroup) -> None:\n        print('Caught runtime error')\n\n    with catch({\n        (ValueError, KeyError): value_key_err_handler,\n        RuntimeError: runtime_err_handler\n    }):\n        ...\n\n**NOTE**: Just like with ``except*``, you cannot handle ``BaseExceptionGroup`` or\n``ExceptionGroup`` with ``catch()``.\n\nSuppressing exceptions\n======================\n\nThis library contains a backport of the ``contextlib.suppress()`` context manager from\nPython 3.12.1. It allows you to selectively ignore certain exceptions, even when they're\ninside exception groups::\n\n    from exceptiongroup import suppress\n\n    with suppress(RuntimeError):\n        raise ExceptionGroup(\"\", [RuntimeError(\"boo\")])\n\nNotes on monkey patching\n========================\n\nTo make exception groups render properly when an unhandled exception group is being\nprinted out, this package does two things when it is imported on any Python version\nearlier than 3.11:\n\n#. The  ``traceback.TracebackException`` class is monkey patched to store extra\n   information about exception groups (in ``__init__()``) and properly format them (in\n   ``format()``)\n#. An exception hook is installed at ``sys.excepthook``, provided that no other hook is\n   already present. This hook causes the exception to be formatted using\n   ``traceback.TracebackException`` rather than the built-in rendered.\n\nIf ``sys.exceptionhook`` is found to be set to something else than the default when\n``exceptiongroup`` is imported, no monkeypatching is done at all.\n\nTo prevent the exception hook and patches from being installed, set the environment\nvariable ``EXCEPTIONGROUP_NO_PATCH`` to ``1``.\n\nFormatting exception groups\n---------------------------\n\nNormally, the monkey patching applied by this library on import will cause exception\ngroups to be printed properly in tracebacks. But in cases when the monkey patching is\nblocked by a third party exception hook, or monkey patching is explicitly disabled,\nyou can still manually format exceptions using the special versions of the ``traceback``\nfunctions, like ``format_exception()``, listed at the top of this page. They work just\nlike their counterparts in the ``traceback`` module, except that they use a separately\npatched subclass of ``TracebackException`` to perform the rendering.\n\nParticularly in cases where a library installs its own exception hook, it is recommended\nto use these special versions to do the actual formatting of exceptions/tracebacks.\n\n.. _PEP 654: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0654/\n\n"}},{"download_info":{"url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d1/b3/8def84f539e7d2289a02f0524b944b15d7c75dab7628bedf1c4f0992029c/isort-5.13.2-py3-none-any.whl","archive_info":{"hash":"sha256=8ca5e72a8d85860d5a3fa69b8745237f2939afe12dbf656afbcb47fe72d947a6","hashes":{"sha256":"8ca5e72a8d85860d5a3fa69b8745237f2939afe12dbf656afbcb47fe72d947a6"}}},"is_direct":false,"is_yanked":false,"requested":true,"metadata":{"metadata_version":"2.1","name":"isort","version":"5.13.2","summary":"A Python utility / library to sort Python imports.","description_content_type":"text/markdown","keywords":["Refactor","Lint","Imports","Sort","Clean"],"home_page":"https://pycqa.github.io/isort/","author":"Timothy Crosley","author_email":"timothy.crosley@gmail.com","license":"MIT","classifier":["Development Status :: 6 - Mature","Environment :: Console","Intended Audience :: Developers","License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License","Natural Language :: English","Programming Language :: Python","Programming Language :: Python :: 3","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11","Programming Language :: Python :: 3","Programming Language :: Python :: 3 :: Only","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9","Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: CPython","Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy","Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries","Topic :: Utilities"],"requires_dist":["colorama (>=0.4.6) ; extra == \"colors\""],"requires_python":">=3.8.0","project_url":["Changelog, https://github.com/pycqa/isort/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md","Documentation, https://pycqa.github.io/isort/","Repository, https://github.com/pycqa/isort"],"provides_extra":["colors","plugins"],"description":"[![isort - isort your imports, so you don't have to.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pycqa/isort/main/art/logo_large.png)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/isort.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/isort)\n[![Test Status](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/workflows/Test/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/actions?query=workflow%3ATest)\n[![Lint Status](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/workflows/Lint/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/actions?query=workflow%3ALint)\n[![Code coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/pycqa/isort/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/pycqa/isort)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/isort/)\n[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/isort](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/timothycrosley/isort?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/isort)](https://pepy.tech/project/isort)\n[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)\n[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)\n[![DeepSource](https://static.deepsource.io/deepsource-badge-light-mini.svg)](https://deepsource.io/gh/pycqa/isort/?ref=repository-badge)\n_________________\n\n[Read Latest Documentation](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) - [Browse GitHub Code Repository](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/)\n_________________\n\nisort your imports, so you don't have to.\n\nisort is a Python utility / library to sort imports alphabetically and\nautomatically separate into sections and by type. It provides a command line\nutility, Python library and [plugins for various\neditors](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/wiki/isort-Plugins) to\nquickly sort all your imports. It requires Python 3.8+ to run but\nsupports formatting Python 2 code too.\n\n- [Try isort now from your browser!](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/quick_start/0.-try.html)\n- [Using black? See the isort and black compatibility guide.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/black_compatibility.html)\n- [isort has official support for pre-commit!](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/pre-commit.html)\n\n![Example Usage](https://raw.github.com/pycqa/isort/main/example.gif)\n\nBefore isort:\n\n```python\nfrom my_lib import Object\n\nimport os\n\nfrom my_lib import Object3\n\nfrom my_lib import Object2\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom third_party import lib15, lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8, lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n\nfrom third_party import lib3\n\nprint(\"Hey\")\nprint(\"yo\")\n```\n\nAfter isort:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nfrom third_party import (lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8,\n                         lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14, lib15)\n\nfrom my_lib import Object, Object2, Object3\n\nprint(\"Hey\")\nprint(\"yo\")\n```\n\n## Installing isort\n\nInstalling isort is as simple as:\n\n```bash\npip install isort\n```\n\n## Using isort\n\n**From the command line**:\n\nTo run on specific files:\n\n```bash\nisort mypythonfile.py mypythonfile2.py\n```\n\nTo apply recursively:\n\n```bash\nisort .\n```\n\nIf [globstar](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html)\nis enabled, `isort .` is equivalent to:\n\n```bash\nisort **/*.py\n```\n\nTo view proposed changes without applying them:\n\n```bash\nisort mypythonfile.py --diff\n```\n\nFinally, to atomically run isort against a project, only applying\nchanges if they don't introduce syntax errors:\n\n```bash\nisort --atomic .\n```\n\n(Note: this is disabled by default, as it prevents isort from\nrunning against code written using a different version of Python.)\n\n**From within Python**:\n\n```python\nimport isort\n\nisort.file(\"pythonfile.py\")\n```\n\nor:\n\n```python\nimport isort\n\nsorted_code = isort.code(\"import b\\nimport a\\n\")\n```\n\n## Installing isort's for your preferred text editor\n\nSeveral plugins have been written that enable to use isort from within a\nvariety of text-editors. You can find a full list of them [on the isort\nwiki](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/wiki/isort-Plugins).\nAdditionally, I will enthusiastically accept pull requests that include\nplugins for other text editors and add documentation for them as I am\nnotified.\n\n## Multi line output modes\n\nYou will notice above the \\\"multi\\_line\\_output\\\" setting. This setting\ndefines how from imports wrap when they extend past the line\\_length\nlimit and has [12 possible settings](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/multi_line_output_modes.html).\n\n## Indentation\n\nTo change the how constant indents appear - simply change the\nindent property with the following accepted formats:\n\n-   Number of spaces you would like. For example: 4 would cause standard\n    4 space indentation.\n-   Tab\n-   A verbatim string with quotes around it.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n\"    \"\n```\n\nis equivalent to 4.\n\nFor the import styles that use parentheses, you can control whether or\nnot to include a trailing comma after the last import with the\n`include_trailing_comma` option (defaults to `False`).\n\n## Intelligently Balanced Multi-line Imports\n\nAs of isort 3.1.0 support for balanced multi-line imports has been\nadded. With this enabled isort will dynamically change the import length\nto the one that produces the most balanced grid, while staying below the\nmaximum import length defined.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import (absolute_import, division,\n                        print_function, unicode_literals)\n```\n\nWill be produced instead of:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function,\n                        unicode_literals)\n```\n\nTo enable this set `balanced_wrapping` to `True` in your config or pass\nthe `-e` option into the command line utility.\n\n## Custom Sections and Ordering\n\nisort provides configuration options to change almost every aspect of how\nimports are organized, ordered, or grouped together in sections.\n\n[Click here](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/custom_sections_and_ordering.html) for an overview of all these options.\n\n## Skip processing of imports (outside of configuration)\n\nTo make isort ignore a single import simply add a comment at the end of\nthe import line containing the text `isort:skip`:\n\n```python\nimport module  # isort:skip\n```\n\nor:\n\n```python\nfrom xyz import (abc,  # isort:skip\n                 yo,\n                 hey)\n```\n\nTo make isort skip an entire file simply add `isort:skip_file` to the\nmodule's doc string:\n\n```python\n\"\"\" my_module.py\n    Best module ever\n\n   isort:skip_file\n\"\"\"\n\nimport b\nimport a\n```\n\n## Adding or removing an import from multiple files\n\nisort can be ran or configured to add / remove imports automatically.\n\n[See a complete guide here.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/add_or_remove_imports.html)\n\n## Using isort to verify code\n\nThe `--check-only` option\n-------------------------\n\nisort can also be used to verify that code is correctly formatted\nby running it with `-c`. Any files that contain incorrectly sorted\nand/or formatted imports will be outputted to `stderr`.\n\n```bash\nisort **/*.py -c -v\n\nSUCCESS: /home/timothy/Projects/Open_Source/isort/isort_kate_plugin.py Everything Looks Good!\nERROR: /home/timothy/Projects/Open_Source/isort/isort/isort.py Imports are incorrectly sorted.\n```\n\nOne great place this can be used is with a pre-commit git hook, such as\nthis one by \\@acdha:\n\n<https://gist.github.com/acdha/8717683>\n\nThis can help to ensure a certain level of code quality throughout a\nproject.\n\n## Git hook\n\nisort provides a hook function that can be integrated into your Git\npre-commit script to check Python code before committing.\n\n[More info here.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/git_hook.html)\n\n## Setuptools integration\n\nUpon installation, isort enables a `setuptools` command that checks\nPython files declared by your project.\n\n[More info here.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/setuptools_integration.html)\n\n## Spread the word\n\n[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)\n\nPlace this badge at the top of your repository to let others know your project uses isort.\n\nFor README.md:\n\n```markdown\n[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)\n```\n\nOr README.rst:\n\n```rst\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336\n    :target: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/\n```\n\n## Security contact information\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the [Tidelift security\ncontact](https://tidelift.com/security). Tidelift will coordinate the\nfix and disclosure.\n\n## Why isort?\n\nisort simply stands for import sort. It was originally called\n\"sortImports\" however I got tired of typing the extra characters and\ncame to the realization camelCase is not pythonic.\n\nI wrote isort because in an organization I used to work in the manager\ncame in one day and decided all code must have alphabetically sorted\nimports. The code base was huge - and he meant for us to do it by hand.\nHowever, being a programmer - I\\'m too lazy to spend 8 hours mindlessly\nperforming a function, but not too lazy to spend 16 hours automating it.\nI was given permission to open source sortImports and here we are :)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Get professionally supported isort with the Tidelift\nSubscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-isort?utm_source=pypi-isort&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)\n\nProfessional support for isort is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-isort?utm_source=pypi-isort&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).\nTidelift gives software development teams a single source for purchasing\nand maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances from\nthe experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing\ntools.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks and I hope you find isort useful!\n\n~Timothy Crosley\n\n"}},{"download_info":{"url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/2d/5b/f18eb1823a4cee9bed70cdcc25eed5a75845367c42e63a79010a7c34f8a7/lsprotocol-2023.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","archive_info":{"hash":"sha256=e85fc87ee26c816adca9eb497bb3db1a7c79c477a11563626e712eaccf926a05","hashes":{"sha256":"e85fc87ee26c816adca9eb497bb3db1a7c79c477a11563626e712eaccf926a05"}}},"is_direct":false,"is_yanked":false,"requested":true,"metadata":{"metadata_version":"2.1","name":"lsprotocol","version":"2023.0.0","summary":"Python implementation of the Language Server Protocol.","description_content_type":"text/markdown","author_email":"Microsoft Corporation <lsprotocol-help@microsoft.com>","maintainer_email":"Brett Cannon <brett@python.org>, Karthik Nadig <kanadig@microsoft.com>","classifier":["Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable","License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License","Programming Language :: Python","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11","Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12","Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: CPython","Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy"],"requires_dist":["attrs>=21.3.0","cattrs"],"requires_python":">=3.7","project_url":["Issues, https://github.com/microsoft/lsprotocol/issues","Source, https://github.com/microsoft/lsprotocol"],"description":"# Language Server Protocol Types implementation for Python\n\n`lsprotocol` is a python implementation of object types used in the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

Please submit a Pull Request with your own or any that you find are missing.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe main alternative to _pygls_ is Microsoft's [NodeJS-based Generic Language Server Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node). Being from Microsoft it is focussed on extending VSCode, although in theory it could be used to support any editor. So this is where pygls might be a better choice if you want to support more editors, as pygls is not focussed around VSCode.\n\nThere are also other Language Servers with \"general\" in their descriptons, or at least intentions. They are however only general in the sense of having powerful _configuration_. They achieve generality in so much as configuration is able to, as opposed to what programming (in _pygls'_ case) can achieve.\n  * https://github.com/iamcco/diagnostic-languageserver\n  * https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver\n  * https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim (Neovim only)\n\n## Tests\n\n* `poetry install --all-extras`\n* `poetry run test`\n* `poetry run test-pyodide`\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nYour contributions to _pygls_ are most welcome ❤️ Please review the [Contributing](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) documents for how to get started.\n\n## Donating\n\n[Open Law Library](http://www.openlawlib.org/) is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization.
